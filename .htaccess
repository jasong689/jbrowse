# This Apache .htaccess file is for
# allowing cross-origin requests as defined by the Cross-Origin
# Resource Sharing working draft from the W3C
# (http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).  In order for Apache to pay attention
# to this, it must have mod_headers enabled, and its AllowOverride
# configuration directive must allow FileInfo overrides.
